                </p>    
                <p>
                    My {{ session['years_experience'] }}+ years of work experience combined
                    with my {{ session['skill1'] }} and {{ session['skill2'] }} skills make
                    me a perfect fit for the position of {{ session['job-title'] }} at
                    {{ session['company'] }}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While studying and working toward getting my
                    {{ session['level-education'] }}, I specialized in
                    {{ session['special'] }} to dig deeper and further hone my
                    {{ session['skill3'] }} skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my current role, I was recently recognized for my outstanding
                    performance;
                <p>
                    {{ session['accomplishment'] }}
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m excited to talk to you about the {{ session['job-title'] }} role
                    and how I can help be a part of making steps toward achieving
                    {{ session['company'] }}'s mission.
                </p>
