# Cover Letter Generator

A web application to help users to generate a basic, customized cover letter to jump-start the process of drafting a tailored cover letter for job applications. 

The idea for this project came after completing a lab for Hackbright Academy in which we built a web application using Flask in Python 3 to generate mad libs stories. I then adapted and expanded upon the principles of the project to create a cover letter generator. 

# Goal of the project

Writing cover letters can be a difficult and agonizing process. The goal of this project is to create a tool that makes writing cover letters easy and painless by providing a tailored template.

# Technology

- Python 3 
- HTML / CSS
- Flask 
- Jinja

# Known Issues

The app is not built to handle any unexpected data types or variances in expected input (ex. a full name that isn't composed of 1 first and 1 last). The styling is also not 100% reponsive to fit all screen types.  

# Expected Future Releases

1. Fixes to the above known issues
2. Create more cover letter templates to further customize the user's experience 
3. Login area so users can create and save cover letters 

# Final
 
I create this app after 3 weeks of learning web development at Hackbright Academy in March 2021 to further practice and solidify my knowledge using Flask and Jinja in Python 3 to build a web app.
